  Programming today is a race of software developers striving to write programs with more and better idiot resistance, and a universe that is trying to create more selective idiots. As long as the universe wins.
  For a long time it was a mystery to me how something very expensive and technologically advanced could be so useless. And I soon realized that a computer is a stupid machine that has the ability to do incredibly smart things, while programmers are smart people who have a talent for doing incredibly stupid things. In short, they found each other.
